# What I built<a id="sec-1"></a>

-   added information about running instances
-   added deployment status of the application
-   refresh the page every 2 seconds


# What I would improve<a id="sec-2"></a>

-   documentation of the API endpoints to better understand some terms e.g processgroups
-   make this live, not to refresh every few seconds but on relevant backend changes e.g change in instance count - if an instance is killed it should show up instantly on the dashboard

# How I would determine feature success<a id="sec-3"></a>

-   if the users are able to get the most used information by looking at the dashboard without having to dig in too deep
